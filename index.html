        <p>
          Hi! I’m Tess Ivinjack — a recent UCSB graduate with a B.S. in Statistics &amp; Data Science.
          Welcome to my portfolio.
        </p>

        <p>
          Across my projects, you’ll notice a few recurring themes. I’m especially interested in exploring the
          intersection of data, AI, and creativity, with a focus on areas like music, language, and emerging
          technologies. I’m most excited by opportunities where I can use data to solve real-world problems
          while continuing to grow as a creative thinker and collaborator.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m also drawn to the communication side of data science — explaining concepts clearly, building
          intuitive visualizations, and turning complex information into something approachable and actionable.
          I love learning, meeting new people, and staying open to new paths as I build new skills along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of data, other things I love include peanut butter, movies, the color yellow, and dance :)
        </p>

      <!-- SOUND ETHICS -->
      <section id="sound-ethics" class="section project">
        <h2 class="page-title">Sound Ethics Capstone</h2>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your finalized writeup text here -->
          Question: Given a song, is it AI-generated or authentic? That was the question my capstone group
          tried to answer by building a detection model for our year-long project.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your finalized approach here -->
          After reading research papers, we found generalization was a key challenge and expanded our dataset
          by generating additional music from multiple generators, then fine-tuned a classifier from scratch.
        </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your results here -->
          Our generalized model improved substantially over the original baseline and performed well on
          previously unseen generators.
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue expanding the dataset to improve generalization.</li>
          <li>Explore finer-grained detection (e.g., identifying AI-generated segments).</li>
          <li>Deploy the classifier for broader use by artists and platforms.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- MOVIE RECOMMENDER -->
      <section id="movie-recommender" class="section project">
        <h2 class="page-title">Movie Recommender System</h2>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your context here -->
          People have different tastes, and you don’t know whether a movie is “good” until you watch it.
          This project focused on recommending similar movies based on what a user already likes.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your approach here -->
          Using data from the TMDb API, we built a hybrid system: content-based recommendations for cold-start
          movies and collaborative filtering for movies with reviews.
        </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your results here -->
          The system produced reasonable recommendations in qualitative tests, and the hybrid approach helped
          address the cold-start problem.
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Incorporate additional content signals (e.g., production companies, keywords).</li>
          <li>Expand review coverage by integrating additional sources.</li>
          <li>Refine feature weighting and evaluate with user feedback.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- MUSIC GENERATION -->
      <section id="music-generation" class="section project">
        <h2 class="page-title">Symbolic Music Generation</h2>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your context here -->
          We used the NES-MDB dataset (Nintendo game soundtracks) to generate symbolic music with an LSTM.
          The model predicts note sequences and outputs MIDI.
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your approach here -->
          We implemented unconditioned generation and extended to conditioned harmony generation by feeding
          melody input and generating arpeggiated triads for a retro soundtrack feel.
        </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your results here -->
          The LSTM outperformed a Markov chain baseline for unconditioned generation, and the harmonization
          preserved timing while following basic music theory.
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Extend the symbolic representation to include rhythm and expressive dynamics.</li>
          <li>Compare LSTM models with transformer-based architectures.</li>
          <li>Develop evaluation methods that better align with human listening judgments.</li>
        </ul>

          Voting is central to democracy, but turnout varies across regions and demographics. We worked with

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your results here -->
          We found patterns in turnout across geography and demographics and identified factors associated

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Paste your approach here -->

        <p>
          Alongside my project work, I’ve gained experience applying data science concepts in teaching,
          advising, and community-oriented roles. For three years at UCSB, I worked as an Undergraduate
          Learning Assistant for an Introduction to Data Science course, where I supported students in
          understanding programming and statistical concepts through office hours, discussion sections,
          and one-on-one debugging support.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also served as a Peer Advisor for the Statistics and Applied Probability Department, providing
          academic guidance to students and helping manage departmental data and resources. In addition,
          I volunteered with UCSB Carpentries workshops, assisting in sessions on data analysis with R and
          Python, GitHub, and workflow automation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Across these roles, I developed a strong appreciation for clear communication, mentorship, and
          making technical material accessible to diverse audiences.
        </p>

      <!-- INTERESTS -->
      <section id="interests" class="section">
        <h2 class="page-title">Interests</h2>

        <p>
          Through my projects and coursework, I’ve developed a strong interest in exploring the intersection
          of data and creativity. I especially enjoy working with audio and media data, and in an ideal world
          would continue to build in that space.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m also drawn to the communication side of data science — I find data visualization particularly
          compelling, and I think strong storytelling is a powerful and often underrated skill within technical work.
        </p>

        <p>
          While many of my current interests lie in the entertainment and creative technology space, I’m broadly
          excited by analytical roles that tackle meaningful, real-world problems, including applications in health,
          language, and emerging technologies.
